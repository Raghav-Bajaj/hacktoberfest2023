# Engineering Poem

In labs and workshops, we engineer dreams,
With calculations and precise regimes.
We build bridges that touch the sky,
And rockets that dare to fly so high.

From gears and circuits to code and steel,
Innovation is the force we feel.
With every problem that we dissect,
Ingenious solutions we'll connect.

In the world of engineers, we strive,
To make the future come alive.
Through science, math, and endless creation,
We shape the world, a wondrous foundation.
